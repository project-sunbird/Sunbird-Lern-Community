*   <mark style="color:green;">Allow users on the platform to collaborate: Sunbird Lern components can be configured to give users on the platform collaboration capabilities. These components include the Groups Service as well as Discussion Forums. The functionalities enabled by the Groups component includes the ability for users to create a Group on the platform, add/ remove users from the group, as well as assign activities (content, assessments etc) for the users in the group to undertake. The Group creator is also able to track how much of the activities the users have completed. A Group can also have a Dicussion Forum attached to it, which allows a user to start or contribute to discussions on relevant topics. Such capabilities allow for users to learn together as a cohort, as well as engage in useful collaborative activities to further their learning.</mark>
