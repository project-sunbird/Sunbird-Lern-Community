# BATCH SERVICE

The Batch Service comprises APIs that permit for creation of Batches of users in the context of Collections, allowing for Batch management capabilities (tracking progress of users within a batch, assigning of mentors to batches as well as start and end dates for batches, attaching credentials etc.)



The following are a few sample functionalities that the Batch Service APIs can be used for, on the platform:

* [x] Creation of a new batch for an existing/ new course, so as to track a cohort of users who are expected to take the course
* [x] Configurations for the Batch such as - Closed batch (invite only), certificate criteria (minimum score of 70% for the course assessment) etc.
* [x] Extension of the batch end date if need be
*
