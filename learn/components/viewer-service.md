# VIEWER SERVICE

‘Viewer Service’ refers to APIs that record and retrieve progress and scores across all asset types.

It **collects** the “content view updates” and generate events to **process** and **provide** summary to the users.

When a user starts viewing a content, a view entry created. There are three stages when a user view the content. They are **start**, **progress** and **end**. Considering these three stages we have 3 API endpoints to capture this information for each stage.

An event will be generated when a content view ends. The summary computation jobs will read these event to process and compute the overall summary of the collection.

The computed summary will be available from API interface to download and view.

#### Key Features:
