****[**Release-5.0.0**](https://project-sunbird.atlassian.net/issues/?filter=12509) **(Planned release date - 19 Aug'22)**

| **1.** [**Design and plan for decoupling Lern building block from other BB repos and creating its own set up**](https://project-sunbird.atlassian.net/browse/SB-30063)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| The code base of some of the components are spread across different building blocks. This makes the installation and setup difficult. Due to this PR approval and merge takes time. Decoupling the code from other BB repos will help to maintain the repos and code most efficiently. For example, batch service code is spread across many repositories like Sunbird Knowlg, Sunbird Obsrv. Also sunbird-utils repo has the cassandra migration scripts from all components - this needs to be separated. |
| **2.** [**Stabilising of components - increase code coverage and unit test cases**](https://project-sunbird.atlassian.net/browse/SB-30072)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| The code base needs to be further stabilised by bringing in some design changes and also by increasing code coverage and unit tests in components like batch service, notification service etc                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
