# Product Roadmap

#### SB Lern Development plan for AMJ 2022:



\


| **1. Decoupling (understanding of) Lern from other BB repos and creating its own set up**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| Code base of some of the components are spread across different BBs. This makes the installation and setup difficult. Due to this PR approval and merge takes time. Decoupling the code from other BB repos will help to maintain the repos and code most efficiently. For example, batch service code is spread across many repositories like Sunbird Knowlg, Sunbird Obsrv. Also sunbird-utils repo has the cassandra migration scripts from all components. |
| **2. One click deployment solution for entire BB / all components**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Currently it takes significant effort from the adopter to get all the components up and running. One click deployment solution will allow the adopter to quickly install and setup required components on Kubernetes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **3. Code refactoring for components (FTSOW?)**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Some of the components are still having legacy code, which makes those difficult to manage. Code refactoring will bring modularity and help in increasing code coverage and there by code quality.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| **4. Stabilising of components - increase code coverage and unit test cases**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Need to stabilise the code base by bringing in some design changes and also by increasing code coverage and unit tests in components like batch service, notification service etc                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **5. Sunbird RC for credentialing - Deployment and stabilisation**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| The certificate generator module within Sunbird Lern is being replaced with the [Sunbird RC](https://docs.sunbirdrc.dev) service - so as to provide Sunbird RC driven certificates, that are based on the W3C specifications. While implementation of this change is in progress, this effort will be completed (including stabilization of the service post deployment) over the AMJ '22 timeframe.                                                           |
| **6. Create sample setup reference repositories**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| After implementing the **one click deployment solution**, need to create some sample reference repositories which will allow the adopters to setup and run and test the APIs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **7. Deployment and Release processes:**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| i. Build, Deploy and provisioning scripts : refactoring of the provisioning and deployment scripts for the BB                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ii. Be able to deploy existing microservices into a different namespace (SB Ed)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
