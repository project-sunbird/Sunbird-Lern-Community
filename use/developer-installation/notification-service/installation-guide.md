Cassandra Migration in sunbird-utils needs to be run before group service run to create necessary table required by the group service.&#x20;

Database details need to be configured in [cassandra.config.properties](https://github.com/project-sunbird/sunbird-notification-service/blob/release-4.5.0/sb-utils/src/main/resources/cassandra.config.properties) file.

There is no dependency when sending notifications in sync mode. But while sending async notifications, application needs notification samza job to run. This need to be setup along with kafka and hadoop.
